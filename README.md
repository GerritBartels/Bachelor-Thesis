# About this Repository

This repository contains the code to our (Jacob Dudek and Gerrit Bartels) bachelor thesis. We implemented 5 Neural Networks and compared their performance on the task of unconditional text generation. We set up a thorough evaluation scheme, using common automatic evaluation methods and supplemented these results with a human evaluation. Furthermore, we propose two evaluation metrics based on the Jennsen-Shannon Distance that help with judging how well the underlying data distribution has been learnt.
